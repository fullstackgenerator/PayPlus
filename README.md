PayPlus is an ASP.NET Core MVC business management tool that simplifies service tracking, client offers, and invoicing in one integrated system. Designed for efficiency, it handles everything from automated calculations to professional PDF exports while keeping your workflow organized.

The Services module allows users to define and manage the services they offer, including Service Name, Description, and Price, as well as a search option (present in every module).

After entering one or more services, the user can then move to the Partners module to add partners in the same fashion.

Once the user has stored services and partners, they can create an offer in the Offers module. As the Offers module has access to both Services and Partners data, no additional data entries are required in this step. Simply select the Service, Partner, and Date.

The newly created entry is stored in the Offers module.

The offer can even be exported as a PDF.

Should the offer be acceptable to a partner, the user can forward it to the Invoices module through the details button.

It then appears in the Invoices module, where it again has a PDF export option.

If the user would like to examine the invoices at the end of the month, they can do so through the Reports module. This page offers a helpful filter with date and partner details, providing clear information regarding the invoices as well as a PDF export option.

Lastly, the final data is passed to the Calendar module for a clearer visual understanding of what services need to be fulfilled by a certain date.

An additional part of the app is the Travel Orders module, where the user can create and manage travel orders/requests for employees and export them as a PDF.
